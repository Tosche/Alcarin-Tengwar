# Alcarin Tengwar

Alcarin Tengwar is an open-source Tengwar typeface designed to pair well with the [Brill](https://www.brill.com/brill-typeface) typeface; Tengwar is an fictional writing system invented by J.R.R. Tolkien, used in his Lord Of The Rings works.

It is designed to look more typographic and of high quality, with academic context in mind. More detailed design notes can be seen [here](https://tosche.net/fonts/alcarin-tengwar).

The word 'alcarin' means 'brilliant' in the Quenya language, the High-Elven language by J.R.R. Tolkien.
