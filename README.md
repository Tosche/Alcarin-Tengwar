# Alcarin Tengwar

Alcarin Tengwar is a Tengwar typeface designed to pair well with the [Brill](https://www.brill.com/brill-typeface) typeface; Tengwar is an fictional writing system invented by J.R.R. Tolkien, used in his Lord Of The Rings works.

It is designed to look more typographic and of high quality, with academic context in mind. It works best with Brill, but can work with other roman typefaces. More detailed design notes can be seen [here](https://tosche.net/fonts/alcarin-tengwar).

The word 'alcarin' means 'brilliant' in the Quenya language, the High-Elven language by J.R.R. Tolkien.

Alcarin Tengwar is released under Open Font License 1.1.

## Disclaimer
The Brill fonts are owned by Koninklijke Brill NV. They are not licensed under the OFL but under licenses of their own, both [non-commercial](https://brill.com/page/BrillFont/brill-typeface) and [commercial](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/superfamily/Brill).

Alcarin Tengwar is not in any official way associated with either Koninklijke Brill NV or Tolkien Estate (though I have received the blessing of the former; not 100% unofficial). It also does not contain any graphical elements of Brill.

Also, I am a typeface designer, not a linguist. My knowledge on Tengwar and is rusty; if/when you raise issues, I would appreciate an attitude and vocabulary as if you would explain to a newbie.
